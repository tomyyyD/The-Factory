# The-Factory
The Factory is a 2.5-D puzzle platformer indie game made with Unity. 

## The Story
The Factory is an abstract story open to each player's own interpertation. A world of dreary colors, dark rooms, and puzzles. The player must work his way through the world and solve all of the puzzles to escape. 

## Inspiration
This game was inspired by *Inside* and the *Little Nightmares* series. After I finished *Inside*, i didn't quite know what to think, and I sat there for a moment trying to wrap my head around what had just happened. That is the same feeling I strive to create in my own game. The environments of *Inside* and *Little Nightmares* are some of the most interesting places in video games, and I drew inspiration from these fascinating environments.
